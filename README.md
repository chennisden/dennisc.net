# Dennis Chen's Website

Thie is the GitHub repository for my website.
All the code that runs my website is here.
Currently, there's no 

My stack is
    
    React JS + Next JS + Tailwind CSS

I cannot make this clear enough:
**these elements are completely orthogonal**.
There are tools that make them play better together,
but these tools do not serve the same purpose.

In particular, React is the framework,
Next is used for rendering
(it takes a hybrid server-side and client-side rendering approach),
and Tailwind is used for styling the frontend.

This project is using `yarn` as its package manager.
