This is my content that I think is most relevant, has been referenced
more often, or have garnered the most interest.

### Math

- [Math Advance!](https://www.mathadvance.org)

  Math Advance! is the parent organization of MAC, the group behind the
  JMCs and MAT, and MAST, an online AIME training program modeled after
  Evan Chen's [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html).
  This is the organization most people seem to know me for.

- [Careful!](resources/careful.pdf)

  A handout with commonly missed problems on select math contests and
  some psychology on how to avoid mistakes.

### Writing

- [Contest Report](reports/contest-creation.pdf)

  Written with William Dai. This is a reflection on the contests I've
  ran under MAC and some advice for those interested in running their
  own contests. (The [TeX source](reports/contest-creation.tex) is also available.)

### Code

- [DennisCV](https://github.com/chennisden/denniscv)

  A LaTeX document class used to typeset CVs. Scales to multiple pages.
