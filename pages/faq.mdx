These are some questions I've been asked often.
Before asking me a question, please check
if it's already answered on here.

## Math

### Can you look at or help with my contest?

No.

I'm sorry, but I just don't have
the time or energy to help with
other contests right now.
My energy is currently focused on
Math Advance, and even then, I've
started falling behind
where I want to be.

## Programming

### How did you make this website and the Math Advance websites?

I use the following stack for frontend:

    Node JS + React JS + Next JS + Tailwind CSS + MDX

Perhaps some of these tools are unfamiliar to you.
Here's a quick summary on what each of them do.

Node JS is a Javascript runtime.
React JS is the framework.[^library]
Next JS handles page fetching and rendering.
Tailwind CSS is a tool to quickly create
components with utility classes.
MDX, or MarkdownX, is a fusion of
the markdown and JSX filetypes,
and I use it to write the content of the website.

[^library]:
    If we're splitting hairs,
    React is really more of a library
    than a framework.

Now, it's important to understand
that each piece in a stack is orthogonal.
They are not related to each other at all.
Sure, there are _integrations_ that make them
play together better.
But if you don't like a certain piece,
just substitute it for something else.
And above all, understand the general role
that each piece of the stack serves.

As for backend, we use Firebase in the MAT website,
and MongoDB for the MAST website. We have our own server
for the MAST website, and we're not using Mongo Atlas.
