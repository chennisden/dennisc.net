These are some projects that I've written.
Most of them are in TeX right now,
but there are a couple of other things in the works.

All code is on [my GitHub](https://github.com/chennisden).

## TeX
These are some utility packages I've written.
Rather than directly changing the output,
they provide new logical constructs for you
to write your own TeX in.

If you are using Overleaf and want my help,
I will take a page from Evan Chen's book:
> First install LaTeX properly,
> then if it still doesnâ€™t work write to me again.

- [scrambledenvs.sty](https://github.com/chennisden/scrambledenvs.sty)
    
    It provides a macro to declare scrambled environments,
    e.g. scrambled hints or solutions.
    It was written to serve as a replacement to Evan Chen's
    [code for his geometry book](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-latex.html\#L-13).
    Install instructions, for the less LaTeX proficient out there, can be found on [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/chennisden/84c2224b10f0b177e4726db0bec45381).

## Web

- [This website.](https://github.com/chennisden/dennisc.net)
    
    This website was created the following stack:
    Node JS, React JS, Next JS, Tailwind CSS.
    It is written in Typescript.
    It also heavily uses `mdx-bundler`
    to convert `.mdx` files to JSX.
