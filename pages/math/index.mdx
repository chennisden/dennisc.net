desc: Personal math materials and recommendations. See mathadvance.org for MAST materials, including samples.

The majority of my high-quality mathematical exposition is done with [Math Advance](https://www.mathadvance.org). I strongly recommend you head over to [MAST](https://mast.mathadvance.org) in order to get better at math contests, and [MAC](https://mac.mathadvance.org) to learn about our contest.

Therefore, what you'll find here is mostly recommendations, reflections, and personal compendiums.

## Recommendations

I won't list Math Advance resources here because they can all be found at the Math Advance website.

- [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis)
  Evan Chen's olympiad program, which recently has had an RPG component added to it! I've taken many pages out of his book for MAST.

## Reflections

- [Contest Report](contest-creation.pdf)

  A report on the first year of the MAT, which ran online.
