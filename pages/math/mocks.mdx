  Some mock contests that I have written for or personally taken
  and would recommend to prospective competitors.

## Contributed

These are the mock contests I have
written for.
One of my problems must
be on the contest for it to count;
testsolving does not count.

Contests from Math Advance
will not be listed here,
since I see no point when
they are already on the
[MAT website](https://mat.mathadvance.org).

## Taken

These are mock contests I have personally
worked through and recommend. Again,
no Math Advance contests included.

Lists are sorted, in roughly descending order,
of how **topical** I think each contest is.
Topicality is based on recency
and accuracy to the original contest.

Lists are **not** sorted by quality.

### AMCs

- [July 2021 Mock AMC 10/12](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/u404284h2627198p22743854)

  This contest was written by P_Groudon.
  It is a rewrite of his old mocks
  in 2019.
  I did not "officially" take this contest,
  but I did work through many of the questions
  in the first few drafts of this test.

  The Autumn Mock AMC 10
  was "constructed by committee,"
  rather than by a group of people
  with a particular *taste*.
  This is purely speculation,
  but my guess as to why it was so accurate
  is because the MAA construction process
  is similar in some ways.

  I only testsolved the Target Round,
  but it was so good that I'm breaking my rule
  of only putting contests I fully completed
  on this list.
