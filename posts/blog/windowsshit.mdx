title: Windows is shit, and so is school
date: 08-10-21

The thought occurred to me
that if school was represented by an operating system,
it would be Windows.

Windows is shit. It is undeniably, irredeemably, absolutely shit.
It hampers you when you try to do something.
It does not respect the user;
god forbid you try to use a tiling window manager
or change the login menu.
It hides the inner workings of the computer
under deceptive graphical interfaces.
And its interests are not the same as yours.
It employs telemetrics in order to
profit off of blissfully unaware users.

I could go on for much longer.[^win-extended]
But my point isn't that Windows is bad,
and nor is it that school is bad.
[^win-extended] To stake my claim, I will do so.

	- Windows has a ton of forced updates,
	many of which the user never asked for,
	and benefit the user in no way.
	(I take less issue with the mandatory
	security updates.)
	In fact, this is quite similar to
	the constant pushing of new and experimental
	curriculums that state governments
	force on schools and students.

	- Windows comes installed with shitty
	antivirus software that nobody asked for.
	The analogy to be made here is with schedule restrictions
	and graduation requirements.
	Perhaps one could make the argument that these
	schedule restrictions are necessary for a large
	portion of the population,
	who are not so invested in their own education
	or do not have the ability or willingness to
	push forward and determine it themselvess.
	Similarly, you could say that the antivirus software
	that comes pre-installed on a Windows system
	is necessary for the vast majority of people,
	who have no clue how their computer works
	and need to be protected from their own ineptitude.
	Both of these are valid points,
	but a *power user* who can configure their own system
	should not have to *fight against* a program for other people
	who do not know what they are doing.
	Nor should a honors student with A's across the board
	have to fight so hard in order to decide
	the way that *they* learn.
	(I am quite angry about being forced to take
	six classes this year, when there are
	*much* better uses of my time than some filler class
	that I have absolutely no interest in.)

The world would *probably* be a better place
if Ubuntu ran on every machine
that is currently on Windows 10.[^ubuntu]
But even though the installation process
takes less than ten minutes
and the operating system basically
runs out of the box afterwards,
an overwhelming majority of the population
cannot or refuses to invest this time
even though the results are so worthwhile.
This is the case even with today's
"tech-savvy"
people, who have grown up with computers
all their lives and spend a significant
portion of their time on them.
This is because we are collectively pretending
that Windows is not
an absolute hot flaming pile of shit,
even though there exists an abundance
of evidence to the contrary.
So most of us are content to live in a world
where Windows continues to dominate
the desktop OS ecosystem.
[^ubuntu] I specifically say Ubuntu because
	the majority of people are not looking for
	a "do-it-yourself" configuration like Arch,
	and Ubuntu is quite popular,
	so any "how do I do X on Linux" questions
	usually are written explicitly for Ubuntu.
	(Although I think more people should
	try tiling window managers,
	which are certainly *different* from
	your traditional desktop environment.)

So in general, the best way to address this problem
is to spread awareness of the existence of Linux and
[creating accessible guides](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg)
to tools that may interest or be of use to other users.

This is all an analogy.
In general, no matter the specific direction
you think education ought to move in,
we must acknowledge that the current state
of public secondary education is akin to Windows,
we must accept that its quality is not acceptable,
and we must continue to provide freely accessible
and superior alternatives when it comes to learning.

## Ubuntu vs. Arch

This is not really about Ubuntu vs. Arch.
Rather, I am just using the two
as stand-ins for two differing philosophies.
Specifically, I am referring to how
Ubuntu will work for you out of the box
while Arch is moreso targeted towards users
that are willing to put in the work to customize their own system
even at the risk of things going wrong.

There are many differing opinions
between advocates of education reform
on which direction education should be taking.
Some people believe that
though education should follow different standards
it should still work for everyone
without excessive active input.
Others, like myself,
believe that the best way to learn
is to actively drive your education yourself,
actively *choosing* the classes you take
and the way you study,
instead of letting some teacher dictate it all.
It is worth being aware of these differences,
because then you can precisely categorize
different reforms into these mindsets
and analyze the costs and benefits of each this way.

Perhaps the solution that is applied
to different distributions of Linux
should also be applied to education.
Where you are free to choose between Ubuntu and Arch,
you should also be free to choose between
a good "out-of-the-box" education
and an education that you have to configure yourself.[^better]
[^better]: The difference between distributions and modes of education
	is that usually, the students who perform the best
	are in charge of their own education.
	This is close to being objectively and verifiably true,
	using almost any reasonable set of metrics, heuristic or otherwise.
	Whereas for distributions, it is hard
	to make such a strong claim
	for a distribution one way or another.
	And distributions evolve much faster
	than education styles do.
