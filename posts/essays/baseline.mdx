title: Increase Your Baseline
date: 08-24-21

The best way to improve your grade in a particular class is to study harder for it.
So conventional wisdom says the best way to improve your grade in all six of your classes
is to multiply by six, and study harder for every class.
We take this at face value, assuming that everyone who does well is working seven times harder than everyone else.
Otherwise, they have to be a genius.

Very few people follow this advice.
It's because if you think about it for a little,
it's nearly impossible to do so.
Say you're currently putting in about an hour into school every day,
which is a reasonable estimate for any serious student.[^home]
You'd probably have to put in about 30 more minutes for each class
you want to see a noticable improvement in.
Multiply this by six, and you start to see a hellish picture.
You'd have to spend four hours every day to get or maintain the grades you want.

[^home]: I'm talking about an hour outside of school hours. I personally spend much less time because I'm utilizing idle time at school to get some busywork done beforehand.
	
	(Also, I don't really care about school until I absolutely have to.)

Nobody has that sort of time or energy.
Sure, there are some people who can work on hard and interesting projects for hours on end.
But the key word is *interesting*,
and interesting is not how most people would describe a significant portion of their schoolwork.[^conventional][^type]

[^conventional]: The way teachers and some kids like to deal with this
	is by pretending that their schoolwork is interesting.
	Maybe this will get you through all of your classes,
	but at what cost?
	If you can't distinguish between interesting and boring,
	your life will tend to boring,
	because most things *are* boring by default.
	
	This is far too high a price to pay to do well in school,
	particularly because there are much more efficient ways to do that.

	Relatedly, I don't think it's bad or pointless to complain about school.
	Your attitude may not change anything while you're *in* school,
	but it'll definitely change what you do outside of it.

[^type]:
	There are some people who *do* think their schoolwork is interesting.

	They are the type of student to take it at face value when all six of their teachers
	tell them to study harder,
	and by some impossible miracle of self-determination,
	get through the grind year by year
	without going insane.

	It's a pity, really.
	These kids have some of the greatest self-determination
	I've ever seen,
	but the pressures of school have misdirected them so badly
	that one would wonder if they'd be better off
	without as much self-control.

But this is only true if you follow conventional wisdom.
It turns out, unsurprisingly,
that conventional wisdom is wrong here.
There's another choice: becoming a genius.

We typically refer to someone as a genius
when we *think* they break the rules of work and reward.
When they cruise through the hardest math
and science classes with honors.
Whatever your image of a genius is,
there's two things in common:
They get better results relative to everyone else,
and their success is *not replicable*.

At least when it comes to schoolwork,
both of these conceptions are wrong.

Take video games as an example. You, who have never been particularly good at games,
become interested in the new block game that happens to be all the rage
and play two hours every day.
Your friend, who has been good with video games and computers in general since she was a kid,
puts in maybe thirty minutes every other day.
But she quickly becomes better than you, even though you started early.

This would not be particularly surprising. Even though you're putting in more work,
she's better than you because she's starting with a higher *baseline*.

By our definition, your friend is a genius at video games.
She's doing better than you (and all of your friends who are also putting in a lot of hours),
and her performance is not replicable.

But you'd feel really silly if you went and called her a video game genius.
It'd make even less sense to call her a Minecraft genius,
because even though she's better than you, the reason has nothing to do
with Minecraft in particular.

So why do we call people a genius at math (and by math, we really mean math *class*)?
It's because the causal relationship is less clear.[^frustration]

[^frustration]: This is why so many students are frustrated with school.
	It's not just because they can't understand why certain people are doing
	much better than them with much less effort. It's because humans innately want *answers*.
	And if the causal effect isn't clear, this answer is something they won't get.

If you want to replicate the performance of a genius,
you first have to establish a higher baseline.[^risk]
Intuitively, you want to look close to the effects of an elevated baseline
to find its causes.
But think about what the smartest kids in class work on. It's not school.
What the smartest kids work on is almost always building meaningful things.[^building]

[^building]: "Building" does not necessarily mean creating something tangible that you can show someone. Indeed, I got my start in math contests.
	
	But there are some things that are both meaningful and at least unhelpful for school, if not anti-helpful. A couple of examples are skateboarding and drawing (though by no means does that mean you're going to fail school if you skateboard or draw).

	The truth is, school only tests for a certain subset of skills. I don't know why, but training for STEM-related contests seems to correlate the best with doing well in school. The kids good at writing also seem to do well, but those are few and far between.

[^risk]:
	There's a reason some people don't try to improve their baseline.

	If you really work on something interesting, you'll inevitably put school out of the picture. This means you run a real risk of not doing as well in school as you'd like, or even doing worse than before.

	Fortunately, the way grades are determined is very modular so you have time to pull out of your projects and put some work into school if it ever gets to the point where you have to. But beyond that, I don't have any advice.

It feels so counterintuitive. How come the best way to get better at school as a whole
is to ignore it entirely?
It's because if you want to find the component of force $\vec{F}$ in some direction,
you take $|\vec{F}|\cos\theta.$

If you're working on getting better at school, even in general,
the magnitude of $\vec{F}$ will be quite low,
because school just isn't that interesting.[^interest]

[^interest]: The people who find school interesting aren't the ones capable of
	applying $\vec{F}$ with a large magnitude even if its direction is school.
	They're the people who either can't or haven't tried to increase the magnitude of $\vec{F}$
	by pointing it away from school.

This is because you apply yourself at least five times as much
when you're working on something you care about versus something you don't.
And five is a conservative estimate.
*And* for sufficiently small $\theta$,
increasing the value of $\theta$ doesn't really change $\cos \theta$.[^analogy][^studystrategy]

[^analogy]: In fact, this is the primary reason I decided to use this $|\vec{F}|\cos\theta$ analogy. 
	It's because, especially when you're in school, drastic changes in direction do not
	have a strong impact on your school performance.
	Part of it is because the distinguishers some schools implement are quite lax
	(which I am a fan of).

	This analogy is much less applicable when your GPA depends on whether you get an A-, A, or A+.
	These distinguishers are much tighter, so you have less room to fail or not care.
	But even in this case, I still think the main distinguisher for a good portion of the top students
	is that they are starting with a much higher baseline, though I don't know
	how actionable this would be when you don't have a day to relax.

[^studystrategy]: I don't think study strategies are very important because they only give
	small gains in the magnitude of $\vec{F}$. They don't change the direction your studying is going either
	(which I think is quite bad, because the second you set foot out of school
	it immediately stops being useful).

	Sure, they do help in some sense. But I feel like there are much more effective optimizations
	that take much less time to implement, and are more fun to boot.

The main reason more people don't focus on magnitude instead of direction isn't because they've never recieved this advice before. These days, colleges are placing more emphasis on "extracurricular activities" and "being well-rounded." Teachers and counselors are telling students to focus on what they're interested in. Rather, it's because because most people don't feel a *need* to work on something.

There are some people who feel guilty when they don't work on something for a day,
the same way they feel guilty when they go to sleep late or don't exercise for a day.
This is sort of an acquired feeling, and it's really hard to get started on a project
when you don't have any ideas in mind or have a compunction to work.

If you're here and you want to acquire the compunction to work,
know that ideas are one of the most valuable commodities you could ever have.
Most people start with a scarcity of meaningful ideas to implement,
meaning they're at risk of having nothing to do or already have nothing to do at some times.
The recipe for this compunction is a large number of good ideas, enough of which could be good,
and a desire to implement them.

You get ideas by hanging around with smart people and being sufficiently interested in their work.
Chances are, they'll rope you along for the ride eventually and bounce their ideas off of you,
or give you something to do at the very least.

Sooner or later, you'll naturally be leading yourself into your own ideas.
It's really surprising where hanging around with smart people will lead you,
and as long as you make sure you're actively looking for interesting and capable people to talk with,
you won't be running out of ideas any time soon.

You get the desire to implement your ideas *as soon as possible* by failing to do so.

Ideas are like water. No matter how hard you try to hold onto them, they slip out of your mind eventually.
It doesn't matter how meticulously you keep track of them.
This seems like a bad thing at first glance, but it's actually got some pleasant consequences.

First, you won't be hung up on a bad idea for too long or your failure to implement a good one, at least for long. Second, it's what makes you *act* on them. It's because you have this nebulous thought in your head that might go away soon. You *want* to see what it's made of, and maybe you only *try* half of the time and succeed ten percent of the time, but that ten percent is more than enough.[^writing]

[^writing]:
	This is why I enjoy writing so much. You get to see what your ideas are made of.
	If you succeed, you've got something you can revisit. In some cases, it could even
	jump-start your brain: you don't have to do the work of reconstructing what you figured
	out before, because your past self has already laid it out all nice and tidy for you.
	And even if you fail, all you have to do is `rm writing.MD` and stop writing.

But why does working on interesting stuff give you a higher baseline for school?
Probably because in school, you're still going to rely on a base of knowledge to build something.
When I want to build a website, I use my base knowledge of Javascript, React, and Tailwind in order to synthesize them into a specific project. It's no different for history class. You're using your base knowledge of world history in order to synthesize an argument. The difference is just that you only care about the latter for as long as you have to work on it. 

I don't think doing good in school is orthogonal or even antithetical to doing good work.
It's just not a good recipe for doing work, because the skills you need for school are a strict subset
of what you need to do good work.

This doesn't make doing good in school easier than doing good work.
On the contrary, I think it makes it unnecessarily harder to do well in school,
because you're missing so much of the context you'd be getting in the real world.

Imagine if some day, the College Board suddenly announced that for its AP Computer Science course,
it would only be testing you on the `private` keyword.[^apjava]
You would never have to know what `public` is or what it does.
I think about half of the country's AP Computer Science instructors
would take this at its face and completely remove any mention of public methods in their courses.

[^apjava]: For those of you who don't know what AP Computer Science is, replace every mention
of it with "AP Java edgecase" in your head. It's more accurate as a title anyways.

This would be a terrible mistake. Maybe you can memorize the properties of `private`, but without `public`to contrast, you have no clue why it matters.

Or, imagine if you were asked to put a puzzle together,
except you could leave certain holes in the middle.
My guess is that you'd just fill out the entire puzzle
because the pieces in the middle give *context* about the rest of the puzzle
and help you figure out where everything goes.

When I'm talking about a baseline for school,
I am specifically talking about an ability
to piece things together and apply them.
This is the sort of thing you get better at
the more you do it, and the reason you have to
do it yourself is because schoolwork's missing a crucial piece:
namely, you don't care about it.

I don't mean in the sense that you're not concerned about the result. Moreso that the definition of "result" is a grade, not the actual product. That's why your posters are thrown out when you get them back. And who's gotten better at building things by building things they don't care about?

You also have minimal choice in which direction you take things in.
Maybe you get to choose whether you make a poster on Jefferson or Madison,
but it's still the same: you're making a boring poster with random facts you Googled up and are going to forget immediately after. People tend to take a project more seriously if it's not arbitrary, and especially if they get to call a lot of the shots. Because any bullshit leftover is on them.

So what specifically can you do to improve your baseline?
Unfortunately, because improving your baseline is such a broad idea,
any advice I'd give would have to be broad as well.
*Fortunately*, this means that your options are also very broad as well.

When it comes to classes on an individual scale,
you should still try to establish a higher baseline.
Instead of trying to pass each test at a time,
my advice is to take a week or two to relax and take a step back.
Try to look at the subject from the broader perspective.[^reason]

[^reason]:
    This seems like such obvious advice that it might be surprising
    to know that most people do not follow it.
    This is because most people believe
    that they are currently doing this because they have placed
    unfounded trust in their teachers, the College Board, the system,
    or any combination thereof.

    Review days are almost always interpreted as a (limited) *summation*
    of all the material. But this is the wrong way to approach it.
    It should be a *synthesis* of the material.

    And in fact, review days shouldn't just be at the end.
    They should be at the start, because then students know
    what they are building up to and how everything fits in the picture.
    To use puzzles as an analogy again: you should show someone what
    the finished puzzle looks like *before* you show them how you're
    piecing it together. So maybe it would be more accurate to call
    them preview days, though what you really want is much more
    than a preview.

This may mean you don't do so well on the next test or two.
It may or may not be worth it to you. But I think if you can afford it,
it's definitely worth giving a try.

As far as I know, this mostly applies for STEM courses,
because the content is the skill. This is different from humanities courses,
which separate the content and the skill.[^ap]

[^ap]:
    Anyone who's taken an AP History course would know.
    The content itself is tangential to doing well on the exam,
    and what you're really being assessed on is your ability to understand
    and hack an arbitrary set of requirements.

    This is why being interested in math contests establishes
    a higher baseline than being incredibly absorbed by history.
    Because the course isn't actually about history.

    This makes the situation a lot harder for people who like humanities
    (or maybe just don't like STEM) and want to do better in their history classes.
    For those poor folks, I don't really have much to offer
    besides my condolences.

If we're discussing STEM[^english] courses in particular,
my suggestion is to build something related to the course,
no matter how vaguely.
If you want to understand Precalculus better,
my advice is to curate a set of interesting algebraic manipulation problems.
Or maybe write an explanation of trigonometric functions,
making sure to connect them to complex numbers.
If your goal is to get better at AP Computer Science,
write a Minecraft plugin. Or a small game of your own.

[^english]:
    I've already included my thoughts on why this might not work for history classes,
    but I think it's a bit trickier for English class.
    
    English class is definitely nonsense,
    but not exactly for the reasons people might think it is.
    Like math class, I think English class is mostly guilty of
    misrepresentation by omission.
    A subset of what you need to know for good writing is assessed,
    though occasionally some nonsense like MLA formatting or whatnot
    pops up in the weeds.
    
    But I think the main thing that makes me hesitant to recommend
    that people who aren't so good at writing
    start writing for a better grade
    is that I don't think it helps all that much.

    Minus some rounding error, I think what English class assesses
    whether you can communicate a coherent-*sounding* argument
    to some arbitrary audience
    (which is your teacher or AP grader).
    Whereas what you need for good writing is the ability
    to construct an interesting and substantial argument
    for your own sake. (Most good writers don't write
    to make someone else happy.)

    I think it's worth being good at writing for its own sake.
    But trying to write something fast
    or under arbitrary, externally imposed conditions
    is basically synonymous with being good at bullshitting.
    For what it's worth, I think it's incredibly unlikely
    that you come up with something novel and meaningful
    on the fly.
    
    This doesn't mean good ideas can't
    just pop in your head for no reason.
    This happens all the time.
    But when it does come, it comes spontaneously.
    You can't really generate it on demand.

    If there's any benefit writing gives you in English class,
    it's in the prose and the rhetoric.
    When you're writing or reading something,
    there's more clarity and more fun
    when there's an oomph, an emphasis on what
    you want to draw attention to.

    This doesn't work in reverse.
    If you're lucky, English class will teach you
    how to write clever-sounding words
    in a clever-sounding way.
    But you don't know if what you're saying
    is actually clever,
    because you're assessed on grammar and style
    instead of content ---
    because that's all you *can* be assessed on.

It doesn't really matter if you don't finish, by the way.

The primary purpose is just to get into the habit
of making stuff and using the experience you've gained
to make connections and further your knowledge.
Once you've gotten in the habit
of building things for its own sake,
you really won't need my advice anymore.[^advice]

[^advice]:
    In terms of technical content,
    you will need advice.
    But you'll probably figure out on your own
    how many hours to work every day,
    when you should work,
    how to motivate yourself,
    and so on.
    
    It's not just my advice you won't need anymore.
    It's pretty much *any* advice.
    There's lots of good advice out there,
    but I think a lot of it is just curiosities:
    it either isn't immediately actionable,
    or it's something you already understood at some level.

    I call this *passive advice*.
    It's advice that plays out at a much larger scale,
    if it does at all,
    because it isn't immediately actionable.
    In some ways, passive advice is better than active advice
    (which you can immediately act on).
    People generally give you a more complete picture
    when they aren't trying to get you to do something.
    And they *can't* get you to act on passive advice,
    by definition. And nor could you act on it,
    even if you wanted to.

    It's not something you strictly need.
    But if we're going to talk about baselines,
    then passive advice is what raises your baseline
    for *thinking*.
    
    The smartest people you know
    are probably giving you a lot of passive advice.
    In fact, this essay is mostly passive advice.
    
    I think some people get frustrated
    when they ask, "how do I get better grades in math?"
    and aren't met with immediately actionable advice.
    I think they'd be less frustrated if they knew
    the difference between active and passive advice.

But there's an issue of self-confidence
that prevents a lot of people from trying their hand
at something like this.
Maybe they feel silly trying to build something
that they don't even fully understand.
I think it'd be silly to let something like that stop you.

Do you think the Wright brothers knew what they were doing
as they were on the course of making the first airplane?
And do you think the Wright brothers let the skepticism
of those around them stop them in their tracks?

There's one key difference between us and the Wright brothers.
The cost of screwing up for the Wright brothers was a crash
which severely injured Orville Wright
and killed Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge.
The cost of us screwing up is a few hours and a `git reset`.

This isn't an all or nothing situation.
You don't have to try and establish a higher baseline
for *every* school subject you're in.
For one, the skills from building stuff carry over pretty far.
If you really let yourself get lost in whatever you're doing,
you'll end up visiting a lot of fields.
But also, any improvement is better than nothing.
If you get good at math, you'll probably breeze through
most of your STEM-related classes. That's around *half*
of your entire school day.
Life gets a lot easier if you don't have to worry about that.
